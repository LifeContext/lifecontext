```

#### 2️⃣ Create the Conda Environment (first run only)
📦 Inside the `backend` directory, create the environment from `environment.yml`:
```bash
cd backend
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

#### 3️⃣ Start All Services

```cmd
deploy.bat
```
To stop all services:
```cmd
stop.bat
```

##### Linux / macOS
