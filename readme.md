### üõ†Ô∏è Backend and Frontend Configuration & Startup

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure LLM and Vector Services
üì¶ Navigate to the `backend` directory and copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`:
```bash
cd ./backend
cp .env.example .env
```

‚úÖ Fill in your model and vector database API information in the newly created `.env` file. Example configuration:
```python
# LLM API 
LLM_API_KEY = "sk-1234abcd5678efgh9012ijkl"
LLM_BASE_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
LLM_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"

# Embedding API 
EMBEDDING_API_KEY = "sk-embed-9876mnop4321qrst"
EMBEDDING_BASE_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Python Environment
üì¶ In the `backend` directory, create the environment based on `environment.yml` and activate it:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lifecontext
```
